    > In interactive Computer Graphics user have some controls over the picture, i.e., the user can make any change in the produced image. One example of it is the ping-pong game.
    
    In non-interactive computer graphics, the picture is produced on the monitor, and the user does not have any controlled over the image, i.e., the user cannot make any change in the rendered image. One example of its Titles shown on T.V.
